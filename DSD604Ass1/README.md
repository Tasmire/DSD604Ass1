Upon opening this program, you will be presented with the English translation of a random M훮ori place.
To play the game, select the dropdown menu with the placeholder text "Select an answer" and scroll through the list of place names.
Click on the one you believe to be the correct answer and the game will tell you if you are correct or not.
To reveal the components of the M훮ori place name, click the "Need a hint?" button.
All guesses will be displayed in separate lists below the main game.
To pick a new English translation, click "Generate a new place name".
Once a correct answer has been added to the guess list, you can click the M훮ori place name to view its Wikipedia page. The select box also disables after a correct guess so you cannot make any additional guesses.

There is a short video included in this project folder showcasing the functionality of the program.
